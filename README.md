# Hello, I'm a Korean student studying machine learning.

```
Please call me Miriel. 
I started studing in January, 2019. I'm going to record the learning process in this space. 
If I have a small wish, I hope this will someday be a place to direct 
those who are going to start machine learning.

I'll post my codes and papers or books that I have referred to. 
But there may be a lack of detail, so please understand this.
(Beacause I'm not good at it yet..) 
And I post the sites that I used to refer to the most while studying here. 
Most of them are Korean sites, but there are also foreign sites sometimes. Most of them are really good sites.
