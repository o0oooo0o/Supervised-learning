# Hello, I am a Korean student studying machine learning.

Please call me Miriel. 
I started studing in January, 2019.
I'm going to record the learning process in this space. if I have a small wish, I hope this will someday be a place to direct those who are going to start machine learning.

I'll post my codes and papers or books that I have referred to. But there may be a lack of detail, so please understand this.
(Beacause I'm not good at it yet..) And I post the sites that I used to refer to the most while studying here. Most of them are Korean sites, but there are also foreign sites sometimes. Most of them are really good sites.
